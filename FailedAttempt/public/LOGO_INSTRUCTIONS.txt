LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
============================

To add your band logo:

1. Export your logo as "logo.png"
2. Place it in this folder (public/)
3. The final path should be: public/logo.png

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Format: PNG, SVG, or JPG with transparent background (PNG/SVG preferred)
- Size: Square format (1:1 ratio) works best
- Resolution: 200x200px minimum, 800x800px recommended
- Style: Simple, high contrast design works best

WHERE YOUR LOGO APPEARS:
1. PillNav: Small circular logo in the top-left navigation (rotates on hover!)
2. Home Page: Large hero logo in the center of the landing page

FALLBACK BEHAVIOR:
- PillNav: Shows "FA" text logo if your logo.png is missing
- Home Page: Shows "FAILED ATTEMPT" text if your logo.png is missing

Your logo is automatically used in both places once you add it to public/logo.png!
