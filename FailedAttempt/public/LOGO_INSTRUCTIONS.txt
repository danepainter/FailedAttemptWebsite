LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
============================

To add your band logo:

1. Export your logo as "logo.png"
2. Place it in this folder (public/)
3. The final path should be: public/logo.png

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Size: 800x800px or larger (will auto-scale)
- Style: High contrast works best with the dark theme

The home page is already configured to display your logo automatically!

If you don't have a logo yet, the band name "FAILED ATTEMPT" will display 
prominently on the home page as a fallback.
